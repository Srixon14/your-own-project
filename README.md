# Project 4

The topic of my project is the threatened/endangered animal species of all over the world.
The goal is to study and analyze how we humans are extinguishing entire species of animals that have been around for millions of years (much more than us).

-Which species are the most threatened?
-How have their number evolved during the last years?
-Which have already been extincted?
-What can we humans do to stop this extermination?
-Which endangered species have lately increased their number and why?
-Which are the countries with more threatened species?

I will try to answer not only these but also many other questions regarding this issue, and make everyone who sees my presentation aware of it.

Regarging the data, I've already found some datasets which I think I will be able to work with. There are some csv files and some APIs as well.
